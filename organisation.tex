\section{Organisation} \label{sec:org}

The infrastructure group is within Data Production lead by Richard Dubois, there are a number of teams and leads withing this
with given responsibilities. These teams are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Leadership (Richard Dubois): Provide technical and project management for the group.
\item {Data Curation (Brandon White): Maintain Rucio based data backbone system for support of data transfers and retention; data backbone functions, such as data parity, replication and Rucio management of the backbone; bulk downloads and LFA destination.}
\item {Advanced Databases (Fritz Mueller): Provide database services on top of database hardware provisioning for numerous databases for Chile + the US DF. Includes: cassandra, Qserv, user databases, EFD, A\&A, ETL, workflow management, butler. Provide database admin functions such as schema evolution, backup and replication.}
\item {Wide Area Networking: (Phil Demar): Ongoing collaborative network
    architecture to support evolving networks and to sustain a
    monitoring interface appropriate to Rubin Observatory operations,
    from BDC in Chile to the US DF and across the world to other data
    centers.}
  \item {Processing Execution (Hsin-Fang Chiang): Evolve and verify the data release and prompt scientific processing pipelines. Data release processing is applied to batches of multiple visit images grouped together, in contrast to prompt processing, which is applied to each visit as it is received from the telescope. Data release processing includes annual data releases (including single frame processing, coadd generation, coadd processing, object characterization, and annual solar system processing). It also includes periodic regeneration of templates for use in the prompt processing system.}
\item {Infrastructure (TBD): Provide configurable hardware upon which are layered the required science platform, prompt processing and DRP pipelines, including compute nodes, various performance levels of nearline storage and tape backup; account management related to A\&A; data transfer capabilities to the summit, other Data Facilities, IDACs and users; batch processing capabilities. Provide performance monitoring, uptime and usage statistics of the Data Facilities. Enforce network security.}
\item {Alert Vetting System (Michael Schneider): Maintains the Alert
    Vetting System (code and processes), and monitors it during
    operations. The AVS monitors alerts (of satellite nature) and may
    embargo some. It may also put a hold on specific CCD images. This
    is supplied by LLNL with oversight for integration from the RDP A\&P alerts team.}

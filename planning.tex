\section{Planning}\label{sec:plan}

The bottom layer of the Data Facilities is the hardware on which the
platforms run. These require a scalable architecture with sufficient
storage and CPU to support the Data Preview/Release timeline.  This
element requries a design for the architecture followed by an
acquisition and installation plan.

The middle layer includes the infrastructure to support deployment of
hardware and tools for data movement and workflow management.

 The top layer involves the applications: science platform, Qserv and pipelines.

In response to the timeline \secref{sec:timeline} the plan is as follows.

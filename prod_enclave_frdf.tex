\subsection{FrDF}

Rubin French Data Facility (FrDF) is hosted and operated by IN2P3 / CNRS
computing center (\href{https://cc.in2p3.fr/en/}{CC-IN2P3}),
located in Lyon, France. This is a scientific data processing center which
serves several major international projects using a pool of shared computing
resources.

The compute and storage resources for Rubin's DP0.2 through DP1 will be
progressively deployed as need arises. For DP0.2, which involves processing of
the DESC DC2 simulated images, the following resources are deployed and
operational:

\begin{itemize}
\item a GridEngine-powered batch processing farm with compute nodes equiped
with CPUs of x86 architecture (64 bits). The allocation for DP0.2 is equivalent
to 1600 reference CPU cores (Intel Xeon E5-2680v3 @ 2.5GHz, see 
\citeds{DMTN-135}),
\item a POSIX-compliant file storage system implemented by 
\href{https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephfs/index.html}{CephFS} with 1 PB 
available for image data and processing products,
\item a webDAV-compliant object storage system implemented by 
\href{https://www.dcache.org}{dCache} with 1 PB available for image data and
processing products,
\item a dedicated instance of PostgreSQL RBDMS with flash storage for butler
registry databases,
\item a set of 4 dedicated data transfer nodes, each with 10 Gbps network
interface for exchanging data with the other data facilities,
\end{itemize}

Specifically for DP0.2, a subset of the DESC DC2 simulated images will be
processed locally and independently of the other data facilities. The specific
subset of input data will be selected so that the resulting products and the
processing performance can be compared to the ones of the other data facilities.

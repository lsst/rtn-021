%Originally https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b9lk_bqxb2s6VOa94GQalRRXs1AYkFRYVDx1263RiHM/edit#

We need to develop a timeline for what needs done by when in the DFs, assuming something like mid 2023 to show everything is ready, if not scaled up already.
This would mean that everything in the scope document and derived services list would be deployed.

DP0.1 is passed,  we can start working from DP0.2 \citedsp{RTN-001} through to DP2.
See also \cite{RDO-011}.

The Data Produciton Milestones are listed in \tabref{tab:openMilestones} - we may need to add some more specofically for USDF.
\input{openMilestones}

\subsection{Assumptions}

Nothhing new is needed between DP2 and DR1, except more hardware.

\subsection{Data Release Productions}
\subsubsection{ DP0.2 - DESC DC2 reprocessing}
\begin{itemize}
\item start date: Q4 FY21
\item end date: Q4 FY22
\item Target: reprocess DC2 data on IDF; run as first Ops rehearsal
\item At USDF: nothing required? FrDF planning parallel reprocessing and RSP; Probably not using PanDA.
\item Functionality:
\begin{itemize}
\item DRP; AP(?); RSP
\item PanDA and Execution team driving processing
\item some campaign management
\item run as Ops Rehearsal
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{ DP1 - ComCam}
\begin{itemize}
\item start date: Q3 FY22 (Kevin Reil: ready with mirrors etc)
\item end date: Q2 FY23
\item Target: at NCSA; some processing in parallel at USDF, FrDF, UKDF
\item Released Products:
\begin{itemize}
\item full DRP
\item AP, but no live alerts. Apparently there will be canned alerts. Interaction with MPC?
\end{itemize}
\item Functionality:
\begin{itemize}
\item Summit to USDF (? dual path with NCSA ?)
\begin{itemize}
\item transfer images
\item transfer calibrations - bidirectional
\item transfer EFD contents?
\item AuxTel???
\end{itemize}
\item DF production
\begin{itemize}
\item set up as processing site with sufficient storage and CPU; configurable clusters for AP vs DRP? PanDA at SLAC yet?
\item Qserv + ingest mechanism
\item Butler + ingest
\item RSP
\item connection to brokers for canned alerts. (MPC?)
\item Data movement among DFs
\item campaign management, monitoring and quality assessment
\item IDACS??
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Resources needed
\begin{itemize}
\item Databases installed
\item EFD, butler, PPDB, APDB...
\item PanDA server
\item Rucio instance (?)
\item Qserv size
\item CPU \& storage
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{DP2 - LSSTCam}
\begin{itemize}
\item start date: Q1 FY23 (Kevin Reil: Oct/Nov 2022. But, ready to go then??)
\item end date: Q1 FY24
\item Target: processing at USDF (is this the only processing or does some/all happen at NCSA as well?); FrDF, UKDF
\item Released Products:
\begin{itemize}
\item full DRP
\item AP, with canned and live alerts.
\end{itemize}
\item Functionality in addition to DP1:
\begin{itemize}
\item IDACs
\item Bulk downloads - including policy
\item Resources needed
\item CPU + storage increases
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{DR1 - Survey}
This is already operations.

\begin{itemize}
\item start date: Q2 FY24
\item end date: Q4 FY24
\item Released products - showtime!
\begin{itemize}
\item full DRP
\item AP where templates are availble, with some live alerts.
\end{itemize}
\item Functionality
\begin{itemize}
\item Bulk downloads
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
USDF operations are covered in the operations plan.
However we need \gls{USDF} in place ahead of Rubin  operations so it can function on day one.
This will require some initial setup and running some services in parallel with \gls{NCSA}.
Some tests  run at NCSA will have to be rerun to verify requirements at the \gls{USDF}.

This document captures the time line, structure and plan for getting the \gls{USDF} up.

Sucicess in the setup up of the \gls{USDF} is a shared responsability between SLAC and Rubin Observatory,
t is been done as a preops activity but it has influence on some remaining construction tasks (see \secref{sec:construct}).

\subsection{Enclaves and functionality}\label{sec:enclaves}

A complete service list  and how the relate to enclaves is provided in \appref{sec:services}.

\section{Introduction}
USDF operations are covered in the operations plan.
However we need \gls{USDF} in place ahead of Rubin  operations so it
can be fully functional on day one.
This will require some initial setup and running some services in parallel with \gls{NCSA}.
Some tests  run at NCSA will have to be rerun to verify requirements at the \gls{USDF}.

This document captures the time line, structure and plan for getting the Data Facilities implemented.

Success in the setup up of the \gls{USDF} is a shared responsibility between SLAC and Rubin Observatory,
It is a preops activity but it has influence on some remaining
construction tasks (see \secref{sec:construct}). Similarly, the annual
Data Release Processings are a joint function of the three Data
Facilities (France, UK, US).

\subsection{Enclaves and functionality}\label{sec:enclaves}

A complete service list  and how the services relate to enclaves is provided in
\appref{sec:services}. In brief, these enclaves include: Prompt US
Enclave; Offline Production Enclave; Archive US Enclave; US Data
Access Center; and Development and Integration Enclave. Only the
Offline Production enclave is required for the French and UK facilities.

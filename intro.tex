\section{Introduction}
USDF operations are covered in the operations plan.
However we need USDF in place ahead of Rubin  operations so it can function on day one.
This will require some initial setup and running some services in parallel with NCSA.
Some tests  run at NCSA will have to be rerun to verify requirements at the USDF.

This document captures the time line, structure and plan for getting the USDF up.

Sucicess in the setup up of the USDF is a shared responsability between SLAC and Rubin Observatory,
t is been done as a preops activity but it has influence on some remaining construction tasks (see \secref{sec:construct}).

\subsection{Enclaves and functionality}\label{sec:enclaves}

A complete service list  and how the relate to enclaves is provided in \appref{sec:services}.
